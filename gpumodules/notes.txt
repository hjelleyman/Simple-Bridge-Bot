Plan for how this will work:

For a game:

	parameters: 4 players and a board.

	Cards:
		Assign each player their seat and cards.

	Bidding:
		In turns,
			Tell each player what has been bid so far.
			Ask the player what they would like to bid.
			Check validity of bid, if invalid give a penalty of one trick for that round per invalid bid.
		End after 3 consecutive passes. Contract will be the highest valid bid.

	Play:
		13 times,
			4 times, starting with the declerer or whoever won the last round.
				Tell each player what cards have been played previously and what cards have been played this round,
				Ask each player what to play.
				Check validity of card, if invalid give a penalty of one trick for that round per invalid card.
					invalid cards:
						not in hand, already played, not following suit.

To Do:
-------

Overall
	* Vectorise all the functions for smooth numpy opperations.

Game.py
	* sort out doubling


Player.py
	* decide_bid()
	* decide_card()
